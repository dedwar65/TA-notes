    "1. Given that we can rewrite the national income accounts identity as $$ S - I = NX,$$ **net capital outflow** is defined as the difference between saving and investment, the left hand side of the equation. The **trade balance** is the right hand side of the equation, and is defined as the difference between exports and imports in the setting where they are not assumed to be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **nominal exchange rate** is the relative price of the currencies of two countries. The **real exchange rate** is the relative price of the goods of two countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Suppose a small open economy cuts defense spending; this corresponds to a reduction in $G$. In this case, national saving, defined as $S = Y - C - G$, must increase. Investment is unaffected. So, net capital outflows rises; domestic households supply the remaining funds as foreign investments. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Using the national income accounts identity, the equality of capital outflows and trade balance implies that the trade balance must also rise. This suggests there is a trade surplus. The interest rate is unaffected, since the policy change occurs in the country which is a small open economy. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Lastly, since the real exchange rate is inversely related to net exports, a trade surplus implies that the exchange rate has fallen. With more supply of the domestic currency, its value falls, meaning less of the foreign currency can be bought with a single unit of the local currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Suppose a small open economy bans the import of a foreign good. This corresponds to a shift in the net exports schedule. In this case, saving and investment are unaffected. By the national income accounts identity, the trade balance is also unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, the trade ban leads to an increase in the real exchange rate in this model. Although imports are reduced by the trade ban, the increase in the real exchange rate suggests that foreign goods have become cheaper relative to domestic goods. This implies that exports will be lower and imports will be higher. The two effects offset each other in this version of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. By the theory of purchasing-power parity, the real exchange rate will be fixed, so all changes in the nominal exchange rate result from changes in price levels. So, if Japan has low inflation relative to Mexico, then Mexico's currency will be cheap relative to the Japanese currency. Then the Japanese currency will be able to buy more units of the Mexican currency over time. This corresponds to an increasing exchange rate, with the Japanese currency as the \"base\" currency (i.e. how many Mexican pesos can be bought with a single Japanese yen)."

    "3. Suppose that the demand for goods in a small open economy falls. So exports fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this case, saving and investment are unaffected. However, the net exports schedule shifts to the left since exports fall. Since this is a small open economy, the (world) interest rate is unaffected. The exchange rate must fall as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the exchange rate falls, then foreign goods are relatively expensive comparerd to domestic goods. So citizens traveling abroad will not enjoy this change in the exchange rate, stimulated by the fall in net exports due to the fall in the demand for their local goods. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The open economy needs to do something to either decrease supply or increase investment so that the curve $S-I$, which describes the supply for foreign currency exchange, shifts to the left enough to get the exchange rate back to its original level. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Since taxes affect $S$, the tax rate needs to be increased so that $S$ falls. Investment would be unaffected, and net exports will fall. Since the change occurs in the small open economy, the interest rate will also be unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If $G$ increases in a small open economy, then $S$ falls. This implies that $S-I$ falls, so that $NX$ falls and the economy is in a trade deficit. Since the supply of dollars invested abroad falls, the exchange rate increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "    If, for some reason, the war has an effect on the (world) real interest rate, then the effect may not be the same. That is, the change in the interest rate could rise by enough so that the fall in $S$ is matched by a fall in $I$. In that case, $S-I$ is unchanged, meaning that $NX$ and the exchange rate are unchaged as well.\n",

    "5. This question considers the effects of increased production efficiency and legal protections in a poorer nation.\n",

    "* In this case, in the market for loanable funds, since the investment curve shifts to the right, and the (world) real interest rate is fixed, investment will exceed saving; the economy borrows from abroad and there is a trade deficit.\n",

    "* Again, since the change occurs in a small open economy, the (world) real interest rate is unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
